# Hug-a-ton

Slack application to share love & appreciation with your coworkers.

## Give a hug

Somebody helped you out? Have you seen an awesome contribution? Just send a hug to a coworker with:

    /hug @john.doe [message]

An anonymous message will be posted to `#-hugs_` with your message tagging the _hugee_

## Check your balance

Wanna know the hugs you have available to give, or the hugs you've received? Use:

    /hug balance

You'll get a private message with your balance

## Pay it forward

Got enough hugs from your coworkers? Share the love outside Sysdig with:

    /hug donate [quantity] [charity_link]

A message will be post to #-hugs_ with about the donation and HR will reach out to proceed with the donation.
